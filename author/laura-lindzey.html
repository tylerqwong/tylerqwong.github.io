<p>As soon as I learned that I could order flexible PCBs, I knew I wanted to play with designing &#8220;origami circuits&#8221;, where the board itself is folded and soldered into a sculpture.
A PCB exchange organized by a group of <a href="https://boldport.com/">Boldport Club</a> members gave me the perfect excuse to iterate on a concept and ship it out to an appreciative audience.
My goal for this post is to answer some of past-Laura&#8217;s questions about what working with flexible PCB is like (OK, OK, and to show off the final product&#8230;)<a class="read-more" href="/blog/2019/11/26/origami-butterfly/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>

I&#8217;d been intimidated for years, but finally jumped in.
Also, I love living in the future! For &lt;$20, you can design a PCB, have it manufactured in a factory, and get it mailed to you.
This still seems insane to me.</p>

<p>I woke up to hear the magic word &#8220;penguins&#8221; in the dorm hallway, so I grabbed my camera and ran down to the shore, which led to a lovely afternoon spent following them around the station.
This was all in accordance with my research group's official "penguin policy" stating that penguin sightings have priority over anything but a flight.<a class="read-more" href="/blog/2016/01/20/penguins-visit-zhongshan/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>

<p>I've been working with ice-penetrating radar data for years, and I still think it's so flipping cool that we can see through kilometers of ice using radar.
This is possible because ice is mostly transparent to electromagnetic energy at radar frequencies.
We see reflections at the air/ice interface, within the ice where its properties change, and at the ice/rock (or ice/water) interface.<a class="read-more" href="/blog/2015/07/27/a-brief-introduction-to-ice-penetrating-radar/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>As a student, I often heard that "networking" was the way to get a job. I didn't have a clear picture of what it involved, other than the oft-cited advice of "invite people at your target company out for an informational interview over coffee."  The idea of setting up a coffee date with a stranger just because they work at a company that I'm interested in felt devious and mercenary and awkward - as though I wouldn't be straight-up asking for a job, but kinda-sorta hoping that they'd submit my name. I wish I'd had better examples of what networking looked like, or how it could lead to a job. <a class="read-more" href="/blog/2014/11/11/what-does-networking-look-like/"><span> Read on &#8594; </span></a></p>
